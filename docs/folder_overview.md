Here's a brief overview of the key directories and files:

.gitignore: This file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git when you push changes to your repository. It helps keep your repository clean and excludes unnecessary files.

LICENSE: This file typically contains the license information for your project, specifying how others can use your code.

README.md: A readme file is essential for providing information about your project, its purpose, how to set it up, and any other relevant details.

admin: This directory seems to contain administrative scripts for managing your project, such as creating folder structures and syncing the repository.

config: The config directory often holds configuration files. In this case, there's a .env file, which might contain environment variables or configuration settings.

data: This directory can be used to store data files or datasets related to your project. The "add_data_files_here.txt" file suggests a placeholder for data files.

docs: The docs directory is a common location for documentation files related to your project. The "add_documentation_files_here.txt" file suggests a placeholder for documentation.

src: This directory contains your project's source code. It seems to include scripts for collecting and storing data, the main application script (main.py), and a web server script (web_server.py).

templates: This directory is likely intended for HTML templates used in your web application. You've already placed your "index.html" file here, which is your UI template.

folder_structure.txt: This file appears to document your folder structure for reference, which can be helpful for you and other developers working on the project.
